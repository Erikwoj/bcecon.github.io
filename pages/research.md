##### <b> "Social Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobby" (Job Market Paper)</b>

<p align="stretch">
To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel industry's lobbying on climate change policy? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns and partisan identity on the effectiveness of the fossil fuel lobbying against climate change actions during the 113-115th Congresses. I find that social media campaigns  decrease the effectiveness of the fossil fuel lobbying against climate change actions on Democrats by 0.248%. The effectiveness of the fossil fuel lobbying against climate change actions is at least 10.4% greater on Republicans than on Democrats, and such effect gap between Democrats and Republicans is likely to increase as social media campaigns become more popular. The effect of social media campaigns on Democrats' decisions against climate change actions is quantified as $0.64 million in terms of stakes of lobbying expenditure, which is very small relative to the size of fossil fuel lobbying against climate change actions, $226.14 million. Average rate of returns to fossil fuel lobbying on congressperson's decisions against climate change actions are -13.16% on Democrats and 18.72% on Republicans.

<p align="stretch">
Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper suggests the following main results: climate funds work in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. Funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. Fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries.
